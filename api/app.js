// What it does: This line tells your Express app to use a "middleware" that can automatically handle incoming data sent in JSON format.
// Why it's useful: When you build a web app, the client (like a browser or another app) can send data to your server in JSON format, which is a common way to structure data. For example:

app.use(cookieParser());
// What it does: This line tells your Express app to use a middleware that makes it easier to work with cookies.
// What are cookies?: Cookies are small pieces of data that a web server can store on a user's browser. For example:
// Saving a userâ€™s login session.
// Tracking preferences or activity.
